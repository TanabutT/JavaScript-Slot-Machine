# Slot Machine Game

This is a beginner-level project to create a simplified slot machine game using JavaScript.

**Disclaimer:** The creator does not support or encourage gambling. This project is solely for educational purposes.

## Project Overview

The slot machine game consists of three reels, each with three symbols. The player can bet on a certain number of lines, and each symbol has a varying multiplier. The game has three possible lines to win, and the player wins if they have three matching symbols in a row. If they win on any of the rows, they will win a certain amount of money based on the symbol's multiplier.

## Game Rules

1. Choose the number of lines to bet on.
2. Place a bet amount for each line.
3. Spin the reels.
4. If the symbols on any of the lines match, the player wins a certain amount of money based on the symbol's multiplier.
5. The game ends when the player runs out of money or decides to quit.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply open run 

```
node project.js
```
in your terminal.

## Future Enhancements

- Add sound effects to the game.
- Implement a betting system with different denominations.
- Add more symbols and reels to make the game more challenging.
